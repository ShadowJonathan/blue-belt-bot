# blue-belt-bot
Universal Discord bot written in GoLang

**Note: Blue Belt Bot is still in a experimental version, concider helping the project or using another bot for your administrative needs.**

Install git and go before downloading and compiling this bot, and run `go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo` in any command processor.

After that, build the bot with `go build` within the `/bot` folder, and run the executable program from the same cmd.
(note, the OsX operating system creates a file called "bot" which is not directly runable from the same folder, you have to use `../bot/bot` to run it)
